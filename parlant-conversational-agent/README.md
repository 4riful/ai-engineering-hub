# Loan Approval Conversational Agent with Parlant

A compliance-driven conversational AI agent built with [Parlant](https://github.com/emcie-co/parlant) that guides customers through a structured loan approval process.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a financial services chatbot that helps customers navigate the loan application process. The agent uses a state-based journey to guide users through eligibility checks, document collection, and approval workflows while maintaining compliance with financial service standards using deterministic and rule-based behavioral patterns.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.12 +

2. **Install dependencies:**
    First, install `uv` and set up the environment:
    ```bash
    # MacOS/Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Windows
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Create a new directory for our project
    uv init research-assistant
    cd research-assistant

    # Create virtual environment and activate it
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux

    .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

    # Install dependencies
    uv sync
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create a .env file with your configuration
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

Run the main application:
```bash
uv run loan_approval.py
```

This will start the Parlant server locally on port 8800 with the loan approval agent configured and ready to handle customer interactions.

## Loan Approval Flow

The agent follows a structured conversational journey for processing loan applications:

    N1: Ask them to provide income and loan related details
    N2: Use the tool check_eligibility
    N3: Inform them that they are not qualified for the loan and ask them if they are interested in other types of loans
    N4: Ask them to provide their tax returns and recent pay stubs
    N5: Use the tool process_documents
    N6: Ask them to use our Online Portal to submit their documents, or contact a Loan Specialist at our Customer Care Phone Number for assistance
    N7: Inform them that their application has been approved and a Loan Specialist will review their information and contact them shortly
