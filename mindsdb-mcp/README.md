## üß≠ Project Overview

The **Unified MCP Server** is a powerful solution that enables seamless federated queries across multiple data sources through natural language. 
By combining MindsDB's federated query capabilities with Cursor IDE's interface, users can interact with their data using simple conversational queries in one place.

### üéØ Use Cases
- Data analysis across multiple platforms
- Automated reporting from various sources
- Unified search across company data
- AI-powered data insights

### üîë Key Features

- üîç Query multiple data sources with a single prompt
- üß† Context-aware AI answers tailored to your connected data
- üí¨ Real-time chat interface using Cursor IDE
- üîß Modular design to easily add more data sources
- üê≥ Easy Docker-based deployment

### How It Works

Through MindsDB, you can connect all your data sources and query them as a single database. 
Then you can plug those databases to your AI applications/clients and chat with them through the MCP server.

- User submits a query.
- The client sends user query to the MCP server.
- The MCP server sends the query to the federated data source.
- The federated data source returns the results to the MCP server.
- The MCP server returns the results to the client via the host (Cursor).
- The AI Agent synthesizes a response based on the retrieved information.
- User gets back the generated response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Before installation, ensure you have Docker installed and running.

### Install MindsDB
Run this command to create a Docker container with MindsDB:

```bash
docker run --name mindsdb_container -e MINDSDB_APIS="http,mcp" \
-p 47334:47334 -p 47337:47337 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

Now you can access the MindsDB editor by going to `127.0.0.1:47334` in your browser.

### üì¶ Setting Up Dependencies

Start the Docker container you created above:
```bash
docker start mindsdb_container
```

Start an interactive shell in the container:
```bash
docker exec -it mindsdb_container sh
```

In the shell, run the following commands to install dependencies for Gmail, Slack and GitHub handlers:
```bash
pip install .[gmail]
pip install .[slack]
pip install .[github]
```

Exit the interactive shell:
```bash
exit
```

Restart the container:
```bash
docker restart mindsdb_container
```

## üîå Integrate Data Sources

### üîó Slack

#### Setup a Slack app

2. Create a new app `From scratch`.

3. Go to `Basic Information` under `Settings`.

    - Under `App-Level Tokens`, click on `Generate Token and Scopes`.

    - Name the token `socket` and add the `connections:write` scope.

    - Copy and save the `xapp-...` token - you'll need it to publish the chatbot.

4. Go to `Socket Mode` under `Settings` and toggle the button to `Enable Socket Mode`.

5. Go to `OAuth & Permissions` under `Features`.

   - Add the following *Bot Token Scopes*:

     - `app_mentions:read`
     - `channels:history`
     - `channels:read`
     - `chat:write`
     - `groups:history`
     - `groups:read` *(optional)*
     - `im:history`
     - `im:read`
     - `im:write`
     - `mpim:read` *(optional)*
     - `users.profile:read`
     - `users:read` *(optional)*

   - In the `OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace` section, click on `Install to Workspace` and then `Allow`.

   - Copy and save the `xoxb-...` token ‚Äì you'll need it to publish the chatbot.

6. Go to `App Home` under `Features` and click on the checkbox to `Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab`.

7. Go to `Event Subscriptions` under `Features`.

    - Toggle the button to `Enable Events`.

    - Under `Subscribe to bot events`, click on `Add Bot User Event` and add `app_mention` and `message.im`.

    - Click on `Save Changes`.

8. You can now connect your app to the Slack channel:

    - Go to the channel where you want to use the bot.

    - Right-click on the channel and select `View Channel Details`.

    - Select `Integrations`.
    
    - Click on `Add an App`.

#### Create Database

After these steps are done, you can use tokens generated from points 3 and 5 to initialize the Slack handler in MindsDB.

To connect your data sources with MindsDB, go to the MindsDB editor running locally at `127.0.0.1:47334` and run the following command to integrate Slack:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_slack
WITH ENGINE = 'slack',
PARAMETERS = {
  "token": "xoxb-...",
  "app_token": "xapp-..."
};
```

### üìß Gmail

#### Setup Gmail API

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

    - Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    - If you haven't created a project before, you'll be prompted to do so now.

    - Give your new project a name.

    - Click `Create` to create the new project.

2. Enable the Gmail API:

    - In the GCP Console, select your project.

    - Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

    - In the search bar, search for `Gmail`.

    - Click on `Gmail API`, then click `Enable`.

3. Create credentials for the Gmail API:

    - Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.

    - Click on the `Create Credentials` button and choose `OAuth client ID`.

    - If you haven't configured the OAuth consent screen before, you'll be prompted to do so now. Make sure to choose `External` for `User Type`, and select the necessary scopes. Make sure to save the changes.

    - Now, create the OAuth client ID. Choose `Web application` for the `Application Type` and give it a name.

    - Add the following MindsDB URL to `Authorized redirect URIs`:

        - For local installation, add http://localhost/verify-auth
        - For Cloud, add http://cloud.mindsdb.com/verify-auth.
    
    - Click `Create`.

4. Download the JSON file:

    - After creating your credentials, click the download button (an icon of an arrow pointing down) on the right side of your client ID. This will download a JSON file, so you will use the location to it in the `credentials_file` param.
