# World-class Document Processing Pipeline with Ground X

This application demonstrates how to build a Document Processing Pipeline that processes complex documents with tables, figures, and dense text using GroundX's state-of-the-art parsing technology. Users can upload documents and receive comprehensive insights including extracted text, semantic analysis, key insights, and interactive AI-powered document queries.

We use:

- Ground X for SOTA document processing and X-Ray analysis
- Streamlit for the UI
- Ollama for serving LLM locally

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8.1 or later installed on your system.

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following environment variables:

```
GROUNDX_API_KEY=your_groundx_api_key_here
```

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
# Pull the required model
ollama pull phi3:mini
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
```

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ groundx_utils.py                # Utility functions for Ground X operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                            # Environment variables (create from .env.example)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file/                           # Folder containing files for running evaluation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # This file

üìÅ Evaluation Tools:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evaluation_geval.py             # GEval framework evaluation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run_evaluation_cli.py           # CLI evaluation runner
```

## Usage

1. Upload a document using the sidebar (supports PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, DOCX)
2. Wait for the document to be processed by Ground X
3. Explore the X-Ray analysis results in different tabs:
   - JSON Output: Raw analysis data
   - Narrative Summary: Extracted narratives
   - File Summary: Document overview
   - Suggested Text: AI-suggested content
   - Extracted Text: Raw text extraction
   - Keywords: Document keywords
4. Use the chat interface to ask questions about your document

## Features
